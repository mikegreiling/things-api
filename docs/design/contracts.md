# CLI Contracts

These are the stable, agent-facing contracts of the `things` CLI. They bind from Phase 0 onward; breaking either requires a major version bump. Source of truth in code: [`src/cli/exit-codes.ts`](../../src/cli/exit-codes.ts) and [`src/cli/output.ts`](../../src/cli/output.ts), both covered by regression tests.

## Exit codes

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ok | Success. |
| 1 | Unexpected | Internal error (bug, unhandled condition). |
| 2 | Usage | Unknown command, bad flags, invalid arguments. |
| 3 | VerifyFailed | Mutation executed but read-after-write verification failed (timeout, mismatch, or silent no-op). |
| 4 | Blocked | Mutation refused **before** touching the app: hazard guard or disruption-tier policy. |
| 5 | DriftBlocked | Writes disabled: DB schema fingerprint deviates from the known baseline. |
| 6 | Unsupported | Operation not supported by any available write vector. |
| 7 | Environment | DB not found, Things not installed, permission problems. |

Codes are never renumbered; new codes append.

## `--json` envelope

Every command supports `--json`. Envelope JSON goes to **stdout**; all human/log chatter goes to **stderr**. `apiVersion` bumps only on breaking envelope-shape changes.

```jsonc
// success
{
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "ok": true,
  "kind": "today",              // payload discriminator per command
  "data": { /* command-specific */ },
  "meta": { "dbVersion": 26, "fingerprint": "ok", "elapsedMs": 12 }
}
// failure
{
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "ok": false,
  "kind": "error",
  "error": { "code": "drift-blocked", "message": "…", "remediation": "…", "detail": {} },
  "meta": { "dbVersion": 26, "fingerprint": "drift", "elapsedMs": 8 }
}
```

- `meta.fingerprint` ∈ `ok | drift | user-accepted | unknown`.
- `error.code` mirrors the exit-code family (`verify-failed`, `blocked`, `drift-blocked`, `unsupported`, `environment`, `usage`, `unexpected`) plus finer-grained sub-codes where useful (e.g. `verify-failed/silent-noop`).

## Interaction rules

- **No interactive prompts, ever.** Risky operations require explicit acknowledgement flags (e.g. `--children auto-complete`, `--acknowledge-checklist-reset`), documented in each command's `--help`.
- Every write command's `--help` states its disruption tier, default vector, applicable hazard guards, and exact ack flag names.
- `--help` text is regression-tested output — it is the API contract agents discover the tool through.
